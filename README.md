**12Scales**

**12Scales** is a short online class / app which uses interactive keyboards and quizzes to teach a student how to play all 12 Major Scales on the piano.

Instead of the usual approach - i.e. "take a giant chart of major scales and memorize it," 12Scales breaks the challenge down into easily digestible pieces, with short quizzes for each concept.
