            The Major Scale is a collection of notes which are related to each
            other in a way that gives your ear an idea of <em>where</em> a song
            is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever sang <em>'Happy Birthday To You...'</em> in a group of
            people, and it just sounded terrible? Even if each individual person
            sounds pretty ok‚Äç, if the group collectively sounds like some kind
            of <em>tone-deaf hell chorus</em>, it's probably because they're all
            singing in different keys. That is, they're using different{" "}
            <strong>Major Scales</strong>. (One person is singing in C, while
            another is singing in F, etc)
          </p>
          <p>Let's see what that means.</p>
          <p>
            There are 8 notes in the Major Scale. We'll number them 1 through 8.
            Here's our old friend, the <strong>'C Major Scale'</strong>. (all
            white keys)
          </p>
          <KeyboardNumbered
            keyboardId="kb000Cmajor"
            showAllCircles={true}
            keyboardScale={0.5}
            callbackWhenFinished={() => this.setState({ CScaleDone: true })}
            answers={[
              {
                bottomKey: "C1",
                topKey: "E2",
                scaleNumbers: fullScales.C
              }
            ]}
          />
          <p>
            If you click on{" "}
            <strong>
              <NN num={3} scale={0.8} />
              <NN num={3} scale={0.8} />
              <NN num={3} scale={0.8} />
            </strong>
            ,{" "}

            </strong>{" "}
            on the above keyboard, it should sound like "Jingle Bells."
          </p>
          <p>
            Or if you prefer "Happy Birthday," try:
            <strong>
              <NN num={5} scale={0.8} />
              <NN num={5} scale={0.8} />

              <NN num={5} scale={0.8} />
              <NN num={8} scale={0.8} />

            </strong>

          <p>
            Here's another Major Scale, this time starting on{" "}
            <strong>Eb</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>Try playing the same number sequences on this keyboard.</p>

          <p>
            The songs <em>sound</em> right, but they
            <em> look</em> completely different when you use a different scale.
            The mix of black and white keys give the Eb scale a different
            'shape'. Here are a few other scale 'shapes'. (You don't have to
            learn these, just notice how each one is different)
          </p>
          <Card.Group centered>
            <ScaleCard src={AmajorScale} title={"A Major"} />
            <ScaleCard src={DbMajorScale} title={"Db Major"} />
            <ScaleCard src={BbMajorScale} title={"Bb Major"} />
          </Card.Group>
          <br />
          <br />

          <p>
            Most people don't realize that there are also patterns in the way
            the scales <strong>look</strong>. They may look like random patterns
            of black and white keys, but if you dig a little deeper, there is an
            underlying structure. There are <em>secret mysterious patterns</em>.{" "}
            <span role="img" aria-label="amazed face">
              üò±
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            These patterns aren't obvious (until you see them, that is.) Most
            students just go to the practice room and start memorizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where we depart from the path of 'most students.' There is a
            hidden short cut to our common destination. There is a better way.
